There are five different kinds of cells on a grid map marked by number.

The container is represented as a square matrix.
The numbers 1 through 5 are used to label the different kinds of cells -- the elements of the matrix.
Zero is an empty cell.
Find the largest group of identical numbers adjacently joined to each other and
point out both the quantity of the cells within the group and the number of the cells itself.
