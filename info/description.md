We see five different kinds of cells on a map grid, each marked by a number.

The container is represented as a square matrix.
The numbers 1 through 5 are used to label the different kinds of cells -- the elements of the matrix.
Zero is an empty cell.
Find the largest group of identical numbers neighbotring each other and
figure out both the quantity of the cells within the group and the number the cells contain.

```
1   2   3   4   5

1 - 1 - 1   2   3

1 - 1 - 1   2   2

1   2   2   2   1
|               |
1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1
```
